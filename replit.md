# Discord Bot - Replit Guide

## Overview

This is a Python-based Discord bot built using the discord.py library. The bot features slash commands, message sending capabilities, and a modular architecture for easy expansion. It's designed to be simple to set up and extend with additional functionality.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Framework**: discord.py library for Discord API interaction
- **Architecture Pattern**: Modular command-based structure
- **Configuration**: Environment variables via python-dotenv
- **Logging**: Built-in Python logging with file and console output

### Project Structure
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py              # Entry point and bot initialization
â”œâ”€â”€ bot/                 # Main bot package
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py     # Package initialization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client.py       # Custom Discord bot client
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ commands.py     # Slash command definitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ events.py       # Event handlers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.py        # Utility functions and embed helpers

## Key Components

### 1. Bot Client (`bot/client.py`)
- **Purpose**: Custom Discord bot class extending commands.Bot
- **Features**: 
  - Configures Discord intents for message content and guild access
  - Handles command synchronization (guild-specific or global)
  - Sets up slash commands and events during initialization
- **Design Decision**: Uses slash commands as primary interface for modern Discord interaction

### 2. Command System (`bot/commands.py`)
- **Purpose**: Defines all slash commands available to users
- **Current Commands**:
  - `/ping` - Latency checker
  - `/hello` - Friendly greeting with user mention
  - `/info` - Bot information display
- **Design Decision**: Uses Discord's app_commands tree for slash commands rather than traditional text commands

### 3. Event Handling (`bot/events.py`)
- **Purpose**: Manages Discord events like guild joins, ready state, errors
- **Features**: 
  - Welcome messages for new servers
  - Automatic channel detection for welcome messages
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Design Decision**: Separates event logic from command logic for better organization

### 4. Utilities (`bot/utils.py`)
- **Purpose**: Provides helper functions for common operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Embed creation utilities with consistent styling
  - Success, error, and info embed templates
  - Timestamp management
- **Design Decision**: Centralizes embed creation to ensure consistent visual branding

## Data Flow

### Bot Startup Process
1. Load environment variables from `.env` file
2. Initialize logging system (file + console output)
3. Create DiscordBot instance with proper intents
4. Set up commands and events during `setup_hook()`
5. Sync slash commands (guild-specific or global)
6. Connect to Discord and maintain connection

### Command Execution Flow
1. User invokes slash command in Discord
2. Discord sends interaction to bot
3. Bot routes to appropriate command handler
4. Command executes business logic
5. Response sent back via interaction response
6. Action logged for monitoring

### Event Processing Flow
1. Discord sends event to bot (e.g., guild join, message)
2. Bot routes to appropriate event handler
3. Event handler processes the event
4. Any responses sent to appropriate channels
5. Event logged for debugging

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **discord.py**: Primary Discord API library for bot functionality
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management for configuration
- **asyncio**: Built-in Python library for asynchronous operations

### Discord API Integration
- **Authentication**: Bot token-based authentication
- **Permissions**: Configurable via Discord Developer Portal
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in awareness to avoid API limits
- **Intents**: Configured for message content and guild access

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
- **Bot Token**: Stored in `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable
- **Guild ID**: Optional `GUILD_ID` for faster command sync during development
- **Logging**: Outputs to both `bot.log` file and console

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Command Errors**: Graceful error responses to users with ephemeral messages
- **API Errors**: Comprehensive logging with fallback behaviors
- **Connection Issues**: Automatic reconnection handled by discord.py
- **Missing Permissions**: Proper error handling for insufficient bot permissions

### Scalability Considerations
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add new commands by extending commands.py
- **Separate Concerns**: Commands, events, and utilities in separate modules
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration for different deployment environments

### Development vs Production
- **Guild Sync**: Use GUILD_ID for faster testing in development
- **Global Sync**: Remove GUILD_ID for production deployment (slower but reaches all servers)
- **Logging Level**: Configurable logging levels for different environments
- **Error Handling**: More verbose error messages in development mode

The architecture prioritizes simplicity and modularity, making it easy to extend the bot with additional commands and features while maintaining clean separation of concerns.
